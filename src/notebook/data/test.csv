In fact this is one of my youngest daughters favorite places to get a chicken sandwich; specifically The Spicy Chicken Sandwich. This sandwich has a kick to it that will excite your taste buds and potentially make your nose run.
The reason I am giving this eatery such a high rating is the service! They have the nicest young people staffing this place with great manners and they are so attentive to the customers. They are always VERY busy, but they manage to take your order and get your food to you quite quick. They even walk around and ask if you want your drink re-filled!! That is going above and beyond. My over-all impressions are that they keep the restaurant clean, friendly hard-working staff equals great customer service, and pretty good food (for fast food). I just have to mention this too.... They are closed on Sundays (the Lords Day) to give their employees this day to worship.

Last Wednesday (02/10), my brother-in-law and I ordered two entrees for pickup: I got the 4 oz. Crab Cake Platter with a Mediterranean salad, and he got the Supreme Crab Combo with a Crab Pretzel. Although I enjoyed my crab cake, I wasn't too thrilled with the Mediterranean salad; I thought I was going to get an actual salad and instead I got pasta salad in an odd-tasting peppery sauce (?). Also, I wasn't too keen on the price. $8.99 for a small-ish crab cake is a bit steep in my opinion. I understand good crab meat can be expensive, but I have a feeling Rigatoni's tends to lean towards the high end of the pricing scale for no other reason than the fact that they have no competition. 

My brother-in-law wasn't entirely pleased with his meal. He said it was ""all right"", but then felt nauseous afterwards. He was sick for most of the evening nursing a queasy stomach. My sister tried some of the Crab Pretzel and started feeling sick late that evening into the next morning. Maybe there were some pieces of crab that weren't exactly fresh in that pretzel or in my brother-in-law's meal, but I do know that my crab cake was very good, and the pieces of the Crab Pretzel I ate didn't give me any digestive problems.

When they first opened, there were a few missing touches with their drinks but they quickly found their mojo.

I have visited the Truckee location before and that's where I tried their Cheddar Scallion Scone and oh my, it was a-ma-zing. So when I found out that they were coming to Reno, I was ecstatic. The only downside was they stopped making this pastry maybe a month after they opened their Reno location. I was really bummed. The barista I asked said that it was just not selling. I told her they can just make it for me and I will buy them all -- wishful thinking. I soon tried the Raspberry Ricotta Scone and this has been my new fave. I still wish that one day they would bring my old-school favorite back.

All in all, they have great pastries and sandwiches. Their crepes are also very tasty and they are huge, at least for me. Make sure to try the Espresso Chocolate Bar -- I have never had anything like this before. Another suggestion is the Lemon Ricotta Cookie -- you can totally taste the fresh lemons that were used for this goodness. My favorite sandwich is the Milano. The chipotle sauce (I think that's whats in there) is quite tasty with a tangy, spicy after taste.

As for drinks, I have absolutely loved their mate lattes. I think they are they only one in town that serves mate lattes but I could be totally wrong. I don't really drink coffee and am more of a tea drinker, which makes the mate lattes the perfect drink for me.

After reading other Yelper's reviews, I decided to go back today with several coworkers. I came at this with a different frame of mind.  Zaxby's is not the place you go to eat healthy, nor do they claim to be.  I came at it as Zaxby's vs Chick-Fil-A.  And in that respect, I decided to revise my rating. 

I still prefer Chick-Fil-A, but there is a lot to like at Zaxby's. I got their Nibblers plate today, and also ordered cheese bites, fried pickles and Texas toast to share.  I still think the deep frier needs some work. The fries could be crispier.  The cole slaw was good, and I am a fan of the cheese bites. 

The chicken was good.  I find Chick-Fil-A's to be juicier.  But it wasn't bad at all, certainly not deserving of the 1 star review I gave it before. 

So, bottom line, although I expect to go to Chick-Fil-A more often, I would not hesitate to stop here if the opportunity presented itself.  I'm not quite a fan, but I'll say they are A-OK.",268,3,200907,2009

Our food was great, well cooked high quality cuts of beef and venison served with fresh bread, well cooked asparagus, great salads, and killer garlic potatoes. we're not experts, but it seemed like a good selection of wine and we enjoyed our bottle.

It was pretty hot on the June night we were there. So hot in fact, we corked our bottle early and took it outside to finish it. The service was fine but not amazing.

A different, more hip vibe and a decent burger.  I love that their ketchup packets actually have a useful amount of ketchup in them. Free wifi is a plus, I used it and it worked great. The staff were friendly, and it seemed sincere; they seem happy to be working there.  The Lotaburger came with a substantial meat patty, that had good flavor and texture.  Two complaints.  The chocolate milkshake was bad.  It's the dreaded 'ice milk' from my childhood that the family would buy when we were on hard times financially.  A huge yuk, didn't even finish it.  Also, the Hatch green chiles were too hot.  I love hot, as evidenced by my high ratings for Poco and Mom's here in Tucson and for various NM food venues.  But this was ridiculous, just too much, which takes away from enjoying not only the chile but the hamburger.  I guess if frat boys want to get into a competition to survive high heat in their mouth, this is the place for them.  But the rest of us will have to make a more palatable green chile burger at home.  If I go again, and I might, I'll have a burger sans green chile and stick with a soda rather than the shake.",3,1,200707,2007

Stopped in with my friend for a quick drink since we had a few minutes to spare before meeting others down the street for dinner. Diablo's is very large would be a great place to go for some fun with a larger crowd maybe to catch a game or fight or even enjoy some live music.

The assortment of Moonshine caught our eye on this particular evening so I ordered a strawberry lemonade (strawberry moonshine) and M had a cherry coke (cherry moonshine). Both were actually really good and the alcohol was surprisingly tasty and not overpowering at all. But then our waitress gave us each a piece of fruit from our moonshine jars. Whoooeeeee!

A Saguaro East and a Saguaro West. The East had nothing. I spent an hour there and left.  The West was much better and it's right near Tucson Mountain Park which had scenic views. I didn't even see a place on Yelp to write a review for the East side, that's how quiet it is.

Both parks have roughly 8 - 10 mile driving loops where you can stop, take short hikes, explore the Saguaros and take in the atmosphere of a true desert. The West Park loop is called Bajada Loop Drive.

The East has Sonoran Desert Overlook, a Cactus Forest, Mica View, and Desert Ecology Trail which is about a half mile walk but nothing to see.

The West has 2 good, short little hikes w/ nice views of the desert and beyond. Valley View Overlook Trail was nice especially when I went early in the morning with the sun rising.  The other is Signal Hill Trail.  I took great pics from both trails.

I did watch a short 20 minute film about Saguaro National Park in the West side of the park.  It gives you a background about the Saguaros.

For a national park, Saguaro East and West isn't up there with the other well known parks. But if you're in Tucson, I'd definitely recommend spending 2 - 3 hours at the West side of the park.  Btw, both parks are roughly 20 - 30 miles from each other, on opposite sides of Tucson.  And it's $10 to get in.",62,7,201509,2015
