The owner Jeff was great. I walk with a cane and he made sure I was taken care of, even offering to drive my car around to me. 
I will be back. And back. 


Tuesday 6/14
Well I went back to try out the regular dining experience. 
Very pleased.
The only negatives are there are too many steps. Little fat men consider such things. I also would prefer a 4:30 opening but that's dealable.  
The service is amazing. It's not that they refilled my coffee, they never let it empty!
The lobster bisque was great. Wish they'd try Snapper. 
For dinner I had the duck breast. It was great just a bit on the small side. Desert was the best pecan pie I've ever had. 

Will I go back?? Without doubt. Of course I'm off to camp next week for two months so I don't have a chance to reach ""Oh Murray! Would you like your usual seat?"" status.

I don't know where to begin except at the beginning. Everything inside is new,  as the space has been remodeled. Yet upon walking in, the whole place already smells of grease and fish. I'm guessing it will always be as such but worse with time because this is a one stop shop hodge podge of wings,  seafood,  sandwiches, smoothies, and gyros. Next, we approach the counter to an altercation already in progress. The customers already here are telling us to go unless we want to wait 45 minutes for wings. Well,  already I'm intrigued,  and rarely one to listen to others rantings,  we proceed to order a strawberry smoothie and hot wings. I paid with my card,  which I immediately think might have been another potential headache on its own. They ran it,  reversed it,  and charged it again. We sat down and waited 15 minutes for a smoothie, which was OK. We did indeed wait 45 minutes for the wings, which were good. For medium,  they had a kick and were tasty. Noteworthy, they only have ranch,  no blue cheese. Another customer threw a fit about that. The ranch was not good. Very generic. If you're a dipper, and I am,  no or bad dip can be reason enough for me to give up on wings. Several customers were asking for their wings cooked hard because they were coming out a little underdone. They had no cocktail sauce for the seafood. There is also a language barrier that was contributing to order errors and lengthy turn around times. I don't typically like trying out places on opening day because there are always bumbles, but even taking that into consideration,  this fledgling business had alot of hurdles to jump.",158,8,201310,2013

The building is a dump. I'm serious. It's grunge and not the kind that was popular in the 90's. Celling tiles are about to fall due to water damage, dust collects on the fans and wall decor, the tables looks like they are from a yard sale, and this is all on purpose! 

The food is OK. Nothing to rave about. It's a local hole in the wall with descent food and homemade soft corn tortillas. The tortillas are great, but the rest of the food you're eating is a scale above taco bell.

The walking orientations are in the client/ dogs home. However we pride ourselves on providing the best pet care, and if you are looking for the lowest price, we are not it.

But, a bit disappointed with the pour of the drinks, which is enough to give it 2 out of 5 stars (After all, this is a popular hang out spot for people on Friday nights). I ordered a long island ... two of them actually ... and they both tasted good ... but didn't have that ""i'm filled with alcohol"" taste i'm used to and instead tasted like lemonade. Maybe they used top shelf ingredients that made it smooth, or maybe they just used a lot of mixer (but my guess is the latter). Either way, two of them didn't set me in my place. So, they were a bit weak. 

My first experience of Brew Brothers was the one at the Airport, and the long islands there were A LOT better then the ones I had at the El Dorado, but the airport isn't a friday night hangout.

Free breakfast is always a plus for those of us with limited time. It's not a hot breakfast (I've had so many mass-produced bad ones, so I'm not complaining) but greek yogurt, a huge croissant, an orange and some cranberry juice hits the spot! They leave it at your door though, instead of ringing your bell to wake you. So if you ask for it to be delivered at 7 a.m., check outside your door; by 7:01 it WILL be there. 

Coffee, a variety of teas, cold and hot water, as well as ice and a bowl of assorted fruit are available 24/7 in the lobby. There are doorbells for each room, and the hotel can only be accessed after hours if you have a key card. Floors are acessible with a keycard as well, for extra protection.

They're also extremely helpful.

A few things to note:
Its location on a tight, one way street can cause a little difficulty if you're traveling solo, but if you have one person to unload the car while someone else parks, you should be fine. The parking garage they use is about half a block from the hotel, but you have to drive in a big rectangle to get there. 

There's a stand-up shower instead of the traditional bathtub/shower combo. It fits one comfortably enough... provided that you're not too far from average height and build. (My boyfriend is 6'2 with a football player build and he made out okay.)

Don't expect much of a view. The view from our room was of the side of another building. But that's what the city is for... go out there and see something!

I was home a few weeks ago to celebrate my birthday, so as a special treat, my mom and I had a ""girls day"" together, which included having dinner at Modesto.  We made a reservation for Saturday night and arrived a bit early (around 6), when it was still very uncrowded.  The inside of the restaurant is very cool.  It's filled with dark wood, large floor to ceiling windows, a nice bar, and a good view of the kitchen so you can actually glance over if you choose to see the tapas being prepared.

The menu was very extensive and since we were being decadent (and eyes were bigger than stomachs), we ended up getting six tapas to split between the two of us.  I should also note that since gluten free appears to be the trendiest food intolerance to have lately, the menu conveniently highlights those items and/ or your server can explain ways to make others gluten free.

So here's what we got: bacon wrapped figs stuffed with chevre cheese, goat cheese flan (so unusual), steamed mussels, lamb skewers, the braised beef short rib (a special that night) and the crispy pork belly.  Plus, they brought out a complimentary board of fresh baked bread with olive tapenade and whipped butter.  Yum!

Everything was very good.  The crispy pork belly was a little chewy, but other than that it was fantastic.  The figs were juicy and the bacon crispy (a very good combo of salty and sweet), the goat cheese flan actually had the light, airy consistency expected of flan as well as great flavor, the steamed mussels were bathed in the best broth I've ever tasted (I sopped up extra broth with the bread), the braised beef was well seasoned and very tender and the lamb skewers were perfectly cooked.

We managed to eat everything, but it was a bit of a struggle at the end and we had no room for the famed desserts like the black and white bread pudding or flan.  Ah, well, maybe next time.  

Service was excellent throughout and I would definitely go back in the future to try some more of their dishes and save room for dessert that time too!  Bravo Modesto, bravo!",441,6,201102,2011

The room itself was very spacious, with a separate seating area and a small kitchenette area with sink, microwave, and refrigerator.  We were traveling with another couple, and liked that we each had an area in our room where we could comfortably entertain our group for a drink in the evening.

The bathroom (just a toilet and shower -- the sink is out in the dressing area between the bathroom and closet) was (very) small, but having a shower versus a tub was nice, although I'd recommend they reverse all the bathroom doors to open outward into the dressing area instead of inward.  It's very awkward to have to slip into the small space in between the toilet and shower in order to open and close the door.  And as mentioned in another review, it seemed curious to me why they'd dedicate so much extra space to the room itself, and leave so little for the bathroom -- It's not like use of that room is optional!

We'd stayed at a competitor's similar-tier hotel the night before and loved the free breakfast there, so in contrast we found this one disappointing.  The breakfast sandwiches were pre-assembled (English muffin with egg, meat, and cheese), so if you didn't like something on them you were out of luck.  There weren't any other hot items provided, and not much else to choose from.  The breakfast area was also messy and picked over.

The front desk staff was great -- friendly and efficient.  We asked for a dinner recommendation because we'd seen two barbecue places nearby, and we weren't sure whether to go to one of them or another one we'd been to before a few miles away.

This place is perfect location wise if you are seeing a show at Cannery/Mercy Lounge as it's across the side street from the main parking lot. The restaurant has reserved parking, so parking to eat at the restaurant was not a problem. We then just walked to the show afterwards.

My husband and I ordered the Sorullos de Maiz (sweet corn fritters) for an appetizer. They were good, but I was really expecting more. The corn was really finely pureed and was more pasty. I would have liked more chunky corn, but that's my preference. The batter was crispy, but not as cornmeal-like as I was expecting. But then again I don't eat too much Puero Rican food so I didn't know what to expect! They were served with a savory sauce.

For dinner I had the Pastelon de Amarillos y Vegetales (spinach lasagna made with plantains). I've eaten plantains at Cuban restaurants, so I was expecting this lasagna to have a bit of sweetness to it. It was delicious. Two plantains on top and bottom with plenty of creamed spinach to fill the middle, topped with a top on hot melted cheese. It was very delicious. For my side, I got the mofongo (mashed plantains with garlic). It was a bit dry. It could have used more garlic sauce, which I guess was the tiny bit of sauce drizzled on the plate next to it (there was no sauce on the dish or given to me on the side).

My husband had the Arroz con pollo (yellow rice with chicken). It was good, but I noticed he was always pulling small chicken bones out of his mouth. That would have made my experience with this dish annoying, but overall he enjoyed the dish.

You can really tell this is a small restaurant that offers food at low prices when the baked goods counter is nearly empty by 11AM. Face it people, they can't afford to throw away food at the end of day just to ensure they have everything available in the afternoon. You get the feeling that Chef Dan really cares for the restaurant, and does his best to ensure everything is top notch.  

I've been here over a dozen times, and only once had a merely acceptable meal, where I got some gristle in a pulled pork sandwich. I've had that sandwich 4-5 times so I attribute it to a bad batch of meat from the supplier. Every other meal has been excellent, from the huge omlette's, to the thick and delicious french toast, to the breakfast cuban...

Cons
 
- No wait service in the bar area. You must go to the bar to order everything and the 1 food runner/buser was not good at all about coming and cleaning off dirty dishes from the tables. I carried most of our dirty plates away myself b/c we ran out of room on the table. Yuck! Let's work on the service aspect guys.

- The food is not that great. I would give the food 2.5 stars after multiple visits. 

Pros 

- Awesome atmosphere. The bartender got up and sang a song with the band. Pretty laid back and friendly all around. 

- Kick ass, huge patio/beer garden in the summer, and they have live bands out there too. Always a fun time! 

- They host multiple beer festivals throughout the year.

- Obviously, fantastic locally made micro brews. Pumpkin Ale, Oktoberfest, and Summer lager seasonals are my favorites!

The location is perfect, close to Reading Terminal Market, restaurants, center city, and provides easy access to the other Philly sites! I found the cost per night for a weekend stay to be more affordable than many other hotels in the city and also in the surrounding areas outside the city. 

Our room was very spacious, clean, and well equipped. I was impressed with the overall size of the bathroom and the comfortableness of the bed! I was very pleased with how quiet the hotel floor was at night, even though the hotel was full that weekend, which contributed to the relaxing atmosphere and sleep in the room.

The presentation of the coffee tray was reflective of the high quality of hotel Loews exhibits. In addition to the coffee setting, glasses of ice water were part of the service and the waitperson, who delivered the coffee, was very friendly, professional and helped to start our morning off on a positive note!

The only reason I did not give the last star in the rating was due to the cost of parking. Parking at the hotel is valet only and they charge $49+ per night for guests staying at the hotel, which I find outrageous. Instead of paying this price, we used Parking Panda to locate a parking garage, one block away for only $24 per 24 hours!

We were seated within about 30 minutes, which was not bad given how busy they are. After sitting there for about 25 minutes, we had yet to be approached by a waiter. We let the hostess know and she sent a waiter over to us. He said that he would bring us all waters and be right back. 

Around this time, another large party was seated at the table next to us. They appeared to have 7 people, which was confirmed when the waiter brought our waters to their table and mysteriously ended up with 2 extra glasses... A minute or two after that, a different waiter showed up and apologized, saying there was a mixup with the table assignments.

We figured that it'd be a good idea to go ahead and order while we actually had somebody's attention and placed our appetizer, food and drink orders and asked for waters. That waiter was never seen or heard from again, though... 20 more waterless minutes passed (45 minutes in total by this point) and we were tired of waiting..

We got egg tarts at a pastry shop, fish ball in a curry sauce, spam masubi, Cambodian sausage, boba tea along on stops and the final stop ended with a family style meal with our group members of soup dumplings, mapo tofu, snow pea leaves and fried tofu. Along the way she also pointed out other good places to eat and since I'm a pretty new transplant, I'll definitely be following up on her recommendations.

Going off the last sentence above, I will say avoid the buffet. The soups and the hot food were cold, while the cold food wasn't cold enough. The Middle Eastern food he brought out saved the meal. They do have a regular American food menu so you are better off ordering from that.

Getting a table at Jackson's is hit or miss. Being first come/first serve, it depends a lot on the day and time you go. If I'm with one or two people, I usually just grab a seat at the bar (you can order food there, too). Besides, you'll probably get your order faster that way.

My one beef with Jackson's is that the waitstaff (on the off-chance you're not at the bar) tends to go MIA at any given moment. This is not the type of place you want to take too long in making up your mind. Or to frequent if you're in any type of hurry.

On the other hand, the relaxed atmosphere is what I love about it.

I get it....this is supposed to look like an Italian grotto."" The food is always amazing. I never stray from my chicken alla griglia - two huge breasts of chicken with steamed broccoli and spinach. Last night, we had the polenta and eggplant stack (cold eggplant with mozzarella and roasted peppers) appetizers. For three discerning Italian palates, we were very happy. I had a pizelle for dessert, which my Mom had in her purse from a trip to see her Italian first cousin this weekend. No, I am not joking.",47,5,201002,2010

25 minutes later, there were only two couples ahead of us.

As others have mentioned, the room is small, but there was ample standing room in the back the night we went (~25 ppl in the room altogether). I was surprised at the end of the 45 minute set when the band announced they were taking a quick break and would be back to perform again. We were allowed to sit in for the 10PM set as well! Some people left, others waiting outside came in and the show went on. So it pays to check them out on a slower night!

The music was outstanding, the musicians talented and charming. They take your requests for $5.

people complaining about the price just do NOT know how to shop.  there are bargains hidden in the bulk bins, the 365 brand products, and frozen organic veggies and berries.

the bulk selection here is good. the snack food selection is also top notch. 

things i wouldn't buy here are vitamins (cheaper at vitamin shoppe) most produce  (cheaper at sook hee's or sue's produce) except fair trade bananas which are very competitively priced, and pre packaged or pre made microwave meals - just because i don't eat that anyway. 

pro tip:  check the whole deal either online or in the store for coupons.  often times things go on sale in the store while there is a coupon available.  for example yesterday i got a coupon in the ""whole deal"" for $1 off vegan mayo - AND the brand was also on sale 2/$6 - therefore what would have cost me $8 for two containers, cost me $5.

This is a fantastic addition to our summer barbecues.   They also have a great chipotle spice that I add to everything.  

The bottom line is whatever spice you want, they probably have it, and it will be much more tasty than any spice you can buy at the grocery store.",49,7,201608,2016

--Happy hour prices on the drinks (not food) last as long as a live band is playing. (But....see below)
--Awesome veggie tacos - but they are not on the menu, ask your server to ask the kitchen if they will make them. They officially stopped them but have made them for me when I asked.
--Nice space- has mellow outside tables and couches, fire pits, and is poolside; - has interior bar area with TV's (sports and news going at the same time on different tv's.)

CONS:
--Happy hour drinks are SUPER weak!! Maybe a splash of liquor. Better to order a shot AT the bar so you can watch it being poured.
--Live music crowd....interesting....a VERY mixed crowd of 40+ folks of all sorts. Not a classy or, um, charming crowd, sort of...um, just, be open minded and go with the flow!
--Bathrooms are freakishly far from the bar/restaurant! A waiter had to lead me down this maze of hallways. I was honestly not sure I would find my way back on the first try! Weird.

PRO or CON? YOU DECIDE!
--Live music = interesting! The couple Friday evenings I went, there was this super lounge-y group playing (Edna and Ely B-Cool) and the singer is a real character. Often she walks around singing and talking to everyone and greeting people by name, she is totally lounge-y in every way! Like an over-exaggeration or mocking of lounge singers - but this gal is 100% real. She was so real and into it that I loved her for her passion (if not her originality). Depending on how you choose to see it or on how playful you are at the time, you might see it as sad and lame, awesome and inspiring, or simply fun and hilarious!",6,1,201302,2013

I would think they would do a lot of business on Sundays, but I am not a business owner. There is outdoor seating on the front porch. Walking in, the hostess stand is immediately to your right, the bar is to the left, and the dining room is on your right. They do evidently have poker machines in an enclosed room. Everything is neat and clean, if a bit dark. The restrooms are neat, clean and well stocked.

Last night, I had their special, which was the seafood lasagne. Layers of cheese, noodles, shrimp, crawfish, clams and yummy-ness that when I couldn't finish, it reheated nicely for lunch today. The rest of the food is just ok. You can expect the same at any other chain restaurant, which they are not a chain, but it is just the same. They have no sweet tea, but depending on the waitress, they will add simple syrup, though not all of the wait staff will. Pieces of room temperature bread will be served with your meal, with butter that you can add, but it's not warm enough to melt the butter and does not seem to be homemade.

The queso dip was decent and there was a small salsa bar wich was o.k.  but really the food was sub-par in my opinion. Baby tiny tacos = bummer. I could have eaten maybe 10 easilly. The rice was like pop corn kernels and the re-fried beans were kind of crusty. 

 Seems more like a place for teens/vandy freshmento hang out where they can discuss the finer points of the"" Bieber look"" rather than a place for some serious tacos.

I got a pretty good rate online for the so called ""Executive Level.""

Our room was on one of the top floors of the hotel. We had a nice view out of our window where we could see City Hall. I'm pretty sure we god a good rate to stay on this ""Executive Level"" because the lounge is closed on the weekends, thus no food or drinks for the folks staying on the floor.

The pool is very small. It might be better during the winter when it's cold out because it's in one of those glassed in greenhouse type rooms. There is a hot tub and sauna as well.

One minor complaint I had with this hotel is that the elevators were extremely slow. I'm not sure if all of the elevators we're working. There were times where we had to wait several minutes on our floor. In addition, the waiting area for the elevators in the lobby would get crowded with people waiting to go upstairs.

The hotel is in a great location - only a few blocks from City Hall. There were a lot of theatres nearby, so it's definitely a good place to stay if you're seeing a show.",27,1,201104,2011
